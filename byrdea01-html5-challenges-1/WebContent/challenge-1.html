	<h4>Making Tracks on Mars</h4>

		shows the tracks left by NASA's Curiosity rover on Aug. 22, 2012, as
		it completed its first test drive on Mars. The rover went forward 15
		feet (4.5 meters), rotated 120 degrees and then reversed 8.2 feet (2.5
		meters). Curiosity is now 20 feet (6 meters) from its landing site,
		named Bradbury Landing. This image was taken by a front
		Hazard-Avoidance camera, which has a fisheye lens.

	<h4>Curiosity's First Arm Extension</h4>
	<img src="images/PIA16096_armextended-br2.jpg"
		alt="photo of curiosity's arm fully extended" > The
	extended robotic arm of NASA's Mars rover Curiosity can be seen in this
	mosaic of full-resolution images from Curiosity's Navigation camera
	(Navcam). Curiosity extended its arm on Aug. 20, 2012. The 7-foot-long
	(2.1-meter-long) arm maneuvers a turret of tools including a camera, a
	drill, a spectrometer, a scoop and mechanisms for sieving and
	portioning samples of powdered rock and soil. This mosaic is made using
	three images projected in a perspective view, which means the images
	are combined to appear as if they were taken from a single, larger
	camera. A thumbnail version is available at
	http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA15692 . Curiosity landed on
	Mars on Aug. 5 PDT (Aug. 6 EDT) to begin its two-year mission, using 10
	instruments to assess whether a carefully chosen study area inside Gale
	Crater has ever offered environmental conditions favorable for
	microbial life. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a division of the
	California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, manages the Mars Science
	Laboratory Project, including Curiosity, for NASA's Science Mission
	Directorate, Washington. JPL designed and built the rover. The Space
	Division of MDA Information Systems Inc. built the robotic arm in
	Pasadena.
